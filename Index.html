<p>
Hi, I'm Layla from Shanghai, China. I work for a Swiss digital consulting firm targeting the luxury industry. I graduated from Boston University fairly recently, and I'm still learning different stuff to see what I wanna do.   
</p>

<h3>Why are you taking this course?</h3>
<p>
I think making dynamic website will be a basic skill to have if I want to pursue a career in technology in the future. And I have made some website before using wix, but it'd be cool to learn the nuts and bolts of how web application works.
</p>
<h3>What previous experience do you have with programming?</h3>
<p>
I have learnt some Java, HTML, and CSS. Just the basic stuff. I'm learning JavaScript and JQuery through another class this fall. 
</p>
<h3>Are you working on a Mac, PC, or some other platform?</h3>
<p>
Windows 7 64 bit
</p>
<h3>Anything else we should know?</h3>
<p>Check out the portfolio I made for myself: <a href="http://www.laylali.net">www.laylali.net</a></p>
